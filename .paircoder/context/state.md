# Current State

> Last updated: 2026-05-08

## Active Plan

**Plan:** v0.2.0 CSV pivot is shipped; pipeline downstream stages are next.
**Status:** Scrape stage live; 161-card manifest committed at `data/manifests/latest.json`.
**Current Sprint:** Begin OCR / index / serve stages (currently stubs).

## Current Focus

The CSV pivot is in (`485748f` on `origin/main`). `pursue scrape run` fetches
via curl_cffi with Chrome TLS impersonation and writes a 161-card manifest
(119 PDF / 28 VID / 14 IMG, sha256 `596cc1881aa97d2f…`). 13/13 unit tests pass.

Next step is to run `pursue download run` against the manifest and start
filling out the OCR + ingest + serve stubs.

## Task Status

### Active Sprint

- [x] Apply CSV-pivot patch (extractor → csv_fetcher; manifests_dir split)
- [x] Diagnose 403 — Akamai bot detection on TLS fingerprint
- [x] Switch fetcher to `curl_cffi` with `impersonate="chrome"`; add regression test pinning the contract
- [x] Clean up `.env` — drop stale Playwright vars, set `PURSUE_SCRAPE_USER_AGENT=` empty
- [x] Run `pursue scrape run` end-to-end; manifest written + raw CSV archived to NAS
- [x] Squashed commit + push to `origin/main` (`485748f`)
- [x] `pursue download run` — 133/161 assets on NAS (116 unique PDFs + 14 images; 28 videos off; 3 PDF cards de-duped against paired entries). Required a follow-up fix re-exporting `asset_path_for` (`9debf96`).
- [x] OCR v1 — Tesseract-only, idempotent. `ocr_card` writes `pages.jsonl` + `meta.json` per architecture spec. Smoke-tested on Apollo 17 debriefing PDF (2 pages, 3.9s).
- [ ] OCR full run — `pursue ocr run --manifest data/manifests/latest.json` over all 119 PDFs (~10–20 min wall-clock)
- [ ] OCR Azure DI fallback (auto mode) — currently any low-confidence page is just recorded; fallback engine deferred

### Backlog

- OCR stage (`pursue ocr run`) — currently a stub
- Index stage (`pursue index ingest`) — currently a stub
- FastAPI search service (`pursue serve`) — currently a stub
- DVIDS video ingestion (off by default)

## What Was Just Done

### Session: 2026-05-08 — CSV pivot shipped end-to-end

- Reviewed the `pursue-index-csv-pivot.tar.gz` patch (v0.1.0 → v0.2.0):
  Playwright extractor + runner removed; `csv_fetcher.py` + `normalize.py`
  added; storage split (`PURSUE_DATA_ROOT` vs `PURSUE_MANIFESTS_DIR`);
  models, downloader, CLI updated to the new asset_* shape.
- Diagnosed the 403: Akamai TLS-fingerprint bot detection. Plain httpx is
  blocked even with full Chrome client-hint headers; curl_cffi's
  `impersonate="chrome"` clears the gate.
- TDD: wrote `tests/unit/test_csv_fetcher.py` first — failed on missing
  `_http_get` seam, then went green after rewriting the fetcher.
- Pinned `curl-cffi>=0.7` in `pyproject.toml`; cleaned local `.env`.
- 13/13 unit tests green; arch check clean on every modified file.
- Live `pursue scrape run` produced the 161-card manifest committed at
  `data/manifests/latest.json` (csv_sha256
  `596cc1881aa97d2fa49a45edab14d60802616e73ce125d286120e00d967cafa2`).
- Bundled paircoder + Claude Code integration into the same commit per
  user direction.
- Squashed commit `485748f` pushed to `origin/main`.

## What's Next

1. `pursue download run --manifest data/manifests/latest.json` — pull PDFs
   + images to the NAS; videos stay off (requires DVIDS API).
2. Flesh out the OCR stage (currently stub) — Tesseract first, Azure DI
   fallback for low-confidence pages.
3. Ingest stage — wire SQLAlchemy models into the new manifest schema.
4. FastAPI search service.
